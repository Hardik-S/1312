Statement of Interest – MA in Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies (Research-Creation Project Option)
My academic and artistic work is grounded in an effort to place tradition and contemporary practice in sustained dialogue. As an immigrant and Canadian Citizen, I move between Indian and Western value systems, and this position shapes my approach to fusion as a responsible, interdisciplinary practice rather than a purely aesthetic one. I am committed to work in which creative practice and academic inquiry inform one another, and in which disciplinary boundaries are treated as sites of productive exchange rather than separation. This commitment has taken shape across two domains that are often treated separately but which, for me, have always been inseparable: classical Indian dance, particularly Bharatanatyam, and linguistic inquiry. I am applying to the MA in Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies (TDPS) at York University, because its explicitly interdisciplinary structure and its Research-Creation Project option offer the ideal environment in which to pursue this endeavour as both scholarly research and creative practice. I hold a BA in Psychology (major), Biology (minor), Creative Writing (minor), and a French certificate; my independent study project in psychology led to a Brief Reports publication. I am currently completing an MA in Linguistics; my MRP, supervised by Dr. Robert Stainton and Dr. David Heap, explores an interface of philosophy of language and morphology by re-examining J.L. Austin’s framework for performative utterances using Kannada (of the Dravidian language family) data. In my MRP, I examine how Kannada can perform actions like blessings, requests, or prohibitions through grammatical endings rather than explicit verbs, challenging English-based models of speech acts. I ask how these endings make the intended action clear and what that means for the rules that make an utterance “successful”.
I began training in Bharatanatyam at the age of six, completing my Arangetram in 2018. Bharatanatyam is an Indian classical dance form, and it stands for Bhava (expression), Raga (melody), Tala (rhythm), and Natyam (dance). My Arangetram is a major milestone that included a two-hour solo performance with live music and an audience of about 400. My training spans both the Kalakshetra and Tanjavur styles, grounding me in a classical pedagogy that emphasizes precision, lineage, and disciplined attention to form and technique. Over the years, my engagement with Bharatanatyam has extended beyond performance into teaching and choreography. I have volunteered for nearly six years as a teaching assistant at Sri Sanskriti Dance Academy (where I received the majority of my training, from Smt. Prabha Raghavan) and have choreographed multiple works in both classical and fusion contexts. These experiences have shaped my understanding of Bharatanatyam not simply as a performance form, but also as a structured system of embodied knowledge, one that encodes narrative, emotion, rhythm, and philosophy through highly formalized movement, gesture, and spatial design.
Alongside my classical training, I have increasingly explored fusion-based work as a mode of inquiry rather than departure. During my undergraduate studies, I completed a Dance Basics course that introduced ballet, modern, and Western social dances such as tango and waltz. For my final project, I integrated Bharatanatyam elements into these forms, not to dilute their distinct traditions but to examine how different movement grammars interact when placed in dialogue. This approach has carried into my choreographic work, including a twenty-minute concept dance production in 2024, blending Western and Bharatanatyam elements to recount the experiences of children of immigrants. That project involved extensive research into Hindu philosophy, particularly Advaita Vedanta, and reinforced my conviction that performance can function as a site of philosophical and cultural reasoning, not merely aesthetic expression.
My interest in meaning-making systems is equally reflected in my research background in linguistics and related fields. Throughout my undergraduate and graduate career, I have written multiple research-based term-papers (in Psychology, Biology, Linguistics, and more). I have a published and peer-reviewed Brief Reports article titled “Intelligence and Variability in Personality” under the supervision of Dr. Julie Schermer, and I am currently co-authoring a review paper of Words in Action: An Introduction to the Social Philosophy of Language with my MRP supervisor, Dr. Robert Stainton. I have presented at four conferences in the span of one year, including an international conference in Cuba, with research focused on linguistics and Kannada. This research training has taught me to engage critically with theory, methodology, and data, and has given me experience situating my work within existing research while identifying gaps and productive tensions. My creative publications include a poetry book with BookLeaf Publishing, a self-published poetry book, written works in anthologies and literary magazines, and an experimental writing piece published with a literary journal at Western University. I also sing (trained in Carnatic music, experience in school choirs, etc.), write songs (with pieces on YouTube, SoundCloud, and Instagram), and create visual/digital art and crafts in my free time; I try to bring a creative lens to everything I do, especially in academic work.
What draws me most strongly to TDPS is the opportunity to treat performance itself as a legitimate mode of research. My interest lies in the relationship between linguistic structure and embodied gesture, particularly within Bharatanatyam, where hand gestures (mudras), facial expression, rhythm, and movement operate together as a semiotic system. I am interested in how these gestural systems parallel linguistic phenomena such as morphology, semantics, and pragmatics, and how performance can serve as a method for investigating these parallels. I am increasingly convinced that these questions demand a research-creation approach that allows embodied practice and critical analysis to inform one another.
York’s TDPS program is uniquely suited for this work because it does not isolate dance from theatre or performance studies, nor does it treat creative practice as secondary to written research. The Research-Creation Project option, which combines coursework with a creation-based performance and a substantial critical support paper, aligns directly with how I already work across disciplines. I am particularly drawn to the expectation that the performance component be situated within relevant research and literature, as this mirrors my commitment to grounding creative work in theory, history, and cultural responsibility.
Within the program, I intend to pursue a broad range of coursework across dance, performance, writing, and music in order to expand both my conceptual vocabulary and my creative toolkit, as exposure to unfamiliar forms and methods is essential to my development. While Bharatanatyam remains my primary grounding, I am intentionally seeking an environment that challenges me to step outside my comfort zone in a critical and reflective way. At the same time, I am attentive to the responsibilities involved in working across traditions. My interest in fusion is not driven by novelty or experimentation for its own sake, but by careful attention to lineage, cultural context, and the risk of flattening traditions when they are approached superficially. Graduate study will allow me to refine and articulate this position with greater clarity and depth. 
For my Research-Creation Project, I envision an interdisciplinary work that integrates Bharatanatyam performance with linguistic analysis. One possible direction is a performance-based exploration of Bharatanatyam hand gestures as a linguistic system, examining how meaning is constructed, constrained, and interpreted through embodied form. The creative component could take the form of a public or recorded performance that foregrounds gesture as analytic object, while the accompanying support paper would situate the work within existing research on performance studies, semiotics, linguistics, and South Asian dance traditions. While this project remains open to evolution through coursework and mentorship, it reflects the kind of research I am eager to pursue: work that neither reduces performance to illustration nor treats theory as detached abstraction.
I bring to the TDPS program a combination of sustained artistic training, proven research ability, and a commitment to interdisciplinary rigor. My background across dance, linguistics, and academic research has prepared me to engage seriously with graduate-level research and scholarship while contributing a perspective rooted in years of disciplined, practice-based training. More importantly, I am motivated not only by personal artistic growth, but by the desire to contribute to conversations about how knowledge is produced through performance, how traditions evolve responsibly, and how creative practice can function as critical inquiry.
York University’s MA in TDPS offers the interdisciplinary home I am seeking, one where theory and practice are mutually constitutive. I am looking forward to contributing to this environment and to develop work that reflects the program’s creative and critical commitments.
