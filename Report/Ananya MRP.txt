When Morphology Speaks: Rethinking Explicit Performatives in Kannada through
Austin’s Framework
1. Introduction
Objective: This project investigates whether J. L. Austin's verb-centered model of explicit
performatives can account for Kannada utterances where morphological markers (such as –ali,
–ōṇa, –āgadu) transparently encode illocutionary force, how these markers function as
alternatives to performative verbs, and whether grammaticalized performativity alters the
applicability and/or application of felicity conditions.
Kannada is a major Dravidian language predominantly spoken in Karnataka, India by
over 44 million native speakers. It displays highly developed agglutinative morphology with
intricate case systems, verb agreement, and extensive suffixation (Schiffman, 1979; Steever,
1998), making it a promising site for investigating how languages enact actions through
grammar. J. L. Austin’s foundational work distinguishes constatives, which describe states of
affairs, from performatives, which perform actions through speech itself (Austin, 1962; Austin,
1979). In other words, a performative utterance’s very saying constitutes doing an act (ordering,
promising, naming, etc.) rather than merely describing one, succeeding through felicity
conditions of authority, sincerity, procedural correctness, and contextual appropriateness rather
than merely through truth-value. Explicit performatives contain an unambiguous performative
verb clearly identifying the act performed (promise, apologize, warn, etc.), with the structure “I
(hereby) VERBPERFORMATIVE (that)…” as the paradigmatic model. Austin’s English-centered
framework privileges verbal encoding: “I order you to leave” explicitly names the ordering
action while “Leave!” performs it non-explicitly (or implicitly).
Austin’s account may possibly be read as either (A) an empirical hypothesis about
explicit performatives across languages or (B) a theoretical stipulation defining “explicit
performative” (hereby referred to as “ExP”) in English-specific terms. This study adopts the first
reading, treating his criteria as potentially generalizable claims refinable through typological
evidence. Kannada presents such evidence: although lexical ExPs also occur, many Kannada
performatives require no ExP verb but instead use morphological markers as vehicles of
performativity, systematically signaling illocutionary role—the intended meaning or force of a
speech act—at the type level and encoding action in morphology rather than lexical choice. This
raises a central question: If explicit performativity can be morphologically encoded, must a verb
still “name the action” for the utterance to qualify as explicit? Kannada suggests grammatical
morphology can fulfill the same transparency function Austin attributes to performative verbs,
challenging the assumption that surface-form explicitness must be verb-centered and revealing
that some felicity conditions may be satisfied through grammatical encoding rather than relying
solely on situational context or speaker authority. This provides an opportunity to expand explicit
performativity beyond English-based assumptions toward a typologically broader understanding
of how languages do things with words.

2. Background and Literature Review
2.1 Austin’s Notion of Performative Utterances
Austin’s theory of speech acts emerged in response to the observation that some
utterances do not merely describe reality but actively change it when uttered under appropriate
circumstances (Austin 1962). These are performative utterances, which perform an action
through speaking (e.g., “I name this ship…”), achieve effects in the world because of their
conventional force, and depend on felicity for success. It should be noted that while
performatives are not primarily evaluated by truth conditions, Austin recognized that various
forms of infelicity (including factual misrepresentations) can affect the success of speech acts.
Additionally, his interest in felicity conditions extended beyond performatives to conventional
acts more generally. Austin also introduced distinctions among illocutionary classes of
performatives—verdictives, exercitives, commissives, expositives, and behabitives—to capture
diverse relationships between utterance form, intention, and social authority. Performatives thus
reveal a structural interface between linguistic form and social action. However, Austin himself
notes that these categories are not rigid, that overlap is sometimes inevitable, and that the
expositive and behabitive classes in particular are “messy”, potentially requiring reclassification.
His felicity conditions can be used to determine whether a performative is successful or
“felicitous”:
➢ Preparatory condition (appropriate participants with authority and context)
➢ Essential condition (the utterance must be a conventional procedure and recognized as an
attempt to perform the act)
➢ Sincerity condition (the speaker must have the right beliefs and intentions)
➢ Propositional content condition (the utterance must refer to an appropriate situation)
Within the broader category of performatives, explicit performatives are presupposed to be those
whose surface form transparently names the act performed. For example, “I promise to be there
at 6PM” overtly names the act being performed through a performative verb (promise), whereas
an implicit performative (or ImP) such as “I’ll be there at 6PM,” can perform the same act
(promising to be there at 6PM) without explicitly naming it. Even an utterance such as “Bull!”
(in appropriate circumstances) could be treated as an ImP of warning. Crucially, while certainly
considered performative, Austin seems to categorize the use of grammatical mood alone as ImPs
rather than ExPs.
Explicit performatives can be defined as: given certain circumstances, to say X is to X.
For example, given certain circumstances (e.g. I have wronged a friend), to say “I apologize for
my actions” is to apologize for my actions. For Austin, the strongest diagnostic for explicitness is
the presence of a performative verb (e.g., promise, apologize, warn) in a first-person,
present-tense, active declarative clause. The adverb hereby strengthens the connection between
the utterance event and the action, signaling that the spoken words themselves effect the act. A
key underlying assumption in Austin’s model is therefore that verbal semantics typically locate
the illocutionary force. In languages like English, these conditions often rely on the naming
2
function of the verb, which explicitly states the type of action being enacted. This theoretical
stance assumes that explicitness must be lexically encoded, which may not generalize
cross-linguistically.
2.2 Cross-Linguistic Challenges to Austin's Framework
Austin’s model of ExPs relies on English-specific grammatical features (the first-person
singular present indicative active) which may not be “necessarily marked in all languages” and
creates challenges for cross-linguistic application (Austin, 1962). Austin himself acknowledges
this limitation, noting that languages may lack a continuous present or mark performativity
differently. Recognizing these constraints, subsequent work in illocutionary logic has
acknowledged that such forces are realized through diverse linguistic means including “mood,
word-order, intonation, and stress” rather than solely through verbal semantics (Searle &
Vanderveken, 1985). Additionally, the success of many performatives depends on
“extra-linguistic institution[s]” and culturally specific conventions rather than purely on
linguistic form (Searle, 1989), suggesting that Austin’s verb-centered model captures only one
possible realization of performativity. These challenges motivate examining languages like
Kannada, where morphological mood markers may provide alternative pathways to explicit
performativity.
2.4 Kannada: Morphosyntax and Relevance to Performativity
Kannada presents compelling evidence that performative force may be morphologically
encoded rather than being verb-dependent. In Kannada, morphological markers such as the
optative (−ali) express wishes, blessings, or desired actions; the hortative (–ōṇa) encourages
collective or cooperative action; and the prohibitive (–āgadu) restricts or mandates behavior. In
(1a) below, oḷḷeyadāgali explicitly performs either a blessing or a wish depending on whether the
speaker possesses ritual or social authority (e.g., elder, priest, parent) versus an ordinary
interlocutor. Critically, the performative force itself is encoded in –ali and recognized by all
Kannada speakers; what varies is whether the preparatory condition (speaker authority) elevates
the act from wish to blessing. In (1b), the same morpheme on barali performs either a wish or a
prayer depending on the speaker’s belief system and intent (sincerity condition), though again
the performative force remains transparent regardless. In both (2a) hōgōṇa and (2b) tinnōṇa,
3
(1) –ali (2) –ōṇa (3) –āgadu
a. oḷḷeyad-āg-ali
good-happen-OPT
“May good (things) happen (to you)” //
“Good luck”
a. mane-ge hōg-ōṇa
home-DAT go-HORT
“Let’s go home”
a. gaḍi dāṭ-i īja.l-āgadu
border cross-RES.L swim.INF-PROHIB
“One is not able/permitted to swim past the
border/boundary”
b. ī bēsige(-yalli) maḷe bar-ali
this summer(-LOC) rain come-OPT
“May there be rain this summer”
b. indu rātri horage tinn-ōṇa
today night outside eat-HORT
“Let’s eat out(side) tonight”
b. alli(-ge) hōga.l-āgadu
there-(DAT) go.INF-PROHIB
“One is not able/permitted to go there”
the morpheme is used to explicitly perform a proposal for joint action that any speaker can
felicitously utter. Unlike –ali, the illocutionary act type remains constant (proposal/suggestion)
across speakers. However, the perlocutionary effect (the result of a speech act on the listener; in
this case, the “strength” of the suggestion) may vary based on the speaker’s social standing or
credibility. In (3a) ījalāgadu and (3b) hōgalāgadu, the morpheme transparently signals a
prohibition, but the utterance achieves felicity only when spoken by someone with institutional
or social authority (e.g., border guard, lifeguard, official). When uttered by an unauthorized
speaker, the preparatory condition fails even though the illocutionary force remains
grammatically explicit. This reveals that morphological explicitness can make illocutionary force
transparent while still requiring traditional authority-based felicity conditions.
3. Research Questions and Working Hypotheses
This project addresses the following three research questions and working hypotheses:
1. Can Austin’s definition of explicit performatives account for Kannada utterances in
which performative force is not lexically anchored in a performative verb?
➢ Working hypothesis: Austin’s model insufficiently captures performative force in
Kannada because it presupposes that explicitness must be verbal in nature. This
presumption limits the descriptive accuracy of speech act theory for languages
with potential illocutionary morphology.
2. How do Kannada morphemes such as optative –ali, hortative –ōṇa, and prohibitive
–āgadu encode or account for illocutionary force? And what features allow these
markers to fulfill the role traditionally attributed to performative verbs?
➢ Working hypothesis: In Kannada, explicit performativity is frequently realized
through morphosyntactic encoding, where suffixal mood markers signal the
intended illocutionary action. These forms can serve the same functional role as
performative verbs in English.
3. Do felicity conditions operate differently when performativity is morphologically
encoded? Specifically, could grammaticalization render certain felicity conditions
redundant or automatically satisfied?
➢ Working hypothesis: Some felicity conditions may be structurally encoded in
Kannada rather than pragmatically inferred or lexically encoded. This possibility
indicates that explicitness may not inherently be tied to lexical transparency, but
rather to systematic formal cues accessible to interlocutors.
Together, these hypotheses predict that Kannada morphological explicit performative data
will require theoretical modifications to Austin’s original framework, expanding ExPs beyond
English-derived assumptions and toward a typologically robust model of how languages can
variably enact action through speech.

4. Methodology
This project will use qualitative linguistic analysis to evaluate how Kannada morphology
can directly encode explicit performativity. Data for Kannada ExPs will come from the author’s
native-speaker intuitions, inspired by naturally occurring examples from media, interpersonal
discourse, and ritualized contexts, ensuring both pragmatic accuracy and cross-speaker
validation. I will systematically generate examples across different verb types and social
contexts, testing whether morphological markers alone make illocutionary force transparent to
competent speakers. Examples will be selected to represent prototypical uses while also probing
boundary cases where felicity conditions may be violated. The analysis will identify
constructions using potential ExP markers such as –ali, –ōṇa, and –āgadu, etc., compare the
illocutionary contribution of morphology versus lexical verbs, and examine whether felicity
conditions are satisfied through formal encoding. The findings from Kannada will then be
evaluated against Austin’s criteria for ExPs to determine where revisions are needed to
accommodate languages where morphology can also transparently perform the intended action.
This project does not involve human subjects in new elicitation sessions; ethics approval is thus
not required.
5. Significance and Expected Contributions
This project is expected to advance speech act theory by demonstrating that explicit
performativity does not universally depend on verb-based naming, as assumed in Austin’s
English-centric model. Through evidence from Kannada, the study shows that illocutionary force
can also be morphologically encoded and that some felicity conditions may be inherently
satisfied through morphology rather than the lexicon or pragmatics. These findings can provide a
more typologically inclusive account of explicit performatives, contribute cross-linguistic data
from a major but underrepresented language, and refine Austin’s theoretical framework to better
capture the structural diversity through which speakers perform actions (do things) with words.
