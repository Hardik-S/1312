Briefing Note 1: Augustine's On the Teacher (p162-169)
Augustine’s primary aim in this passage of On the Teacher (pages 162–169 of the
Sourcebook) is to demonstrate that words do not teach; they only remind or prompt the mind to
consult the inner Truth that already contains knowledge. Through a dialectical exchange with his
son Adeodatus, Augustine dismantles the assumption that language is a conduit of
understanding. His goal is not merely to redefine the limits of linguistic instruction, but to
relocate the origin of knowledge itself—from the external, “sensible” realm of words to the
internal, “intelligible” realm of divine illumination. The dialogue’s method mirrors its message:
the act of understanding must occur within the listener, not in the sounds that strike the ear.
Augustine builds this argument by using the dialogue itself as evidence. Rather than
instructing Adeodatus directly, he leads him through a process of discovery that makes the thesis
self-evident. When Augustine presses the core point, “when words are spoken we either know
what they signify or we don’t; if we know, then it’s reminding rather than learning; but if we
don’t know, it isn’t even reminding” (163–164), he turns the process into a demonstration.
Adeodatus is encouraged to think through each claim rather than accept it, and in doing so, the
conversation performs the very thing it argues: comprehension arises in the mind, not through
speech. This exchange also reveals Augustine’s larger pedagogical point that verbal teaching
only reminds the listener of what is already known, pushing the act of learning inward.
Augustine’s argument rests on three key insights. First, words are merely signs: they can
indicate or direct attention toward things, but they do not contain the knowledge of those things
themselves. Second, he distinguishes knowing from believing: we know what we directly
experience through understanding, but we only believe what others report to us, such as events
we have not witnessed. Finally, true learning is an inward process of discovery. The external
teacher’s role is limited to prompting the learner to turn either toward the world of experience or,
more profoundly, toward the “inner Teacher,” the divine Truth that alone imparts genuine
understanding.
To clarify how and why language fails to transmit understanding, Augustine analyzes the
structure of signs. He divides them into two components (the sound and the signification) and
argues that we hear the sound but understand only when we already know what the sound refers
to. His example of pointing at a head captures this distinction well: the gesture reveals the head,
not the pointing itself (163). He argues that language operates in the same way; hearing “tree”
does not show a tree, it only directs the listener’s attention toward one. This distinction between
sign and the thing signified becomes the logical foundation of his argument. Words are merely
indicators that depend on prior familiarity. The implication is that verbal instruction cannot
originate knowledge, it can only activate what is already in the mind.

Augustine reinforces this point by exploring how reference works. When he says, “from
words, then, we learn only words” (163), he exposes a limit in linguistic communication.
Understanding occurs only when a listener already knows the thing referred to. If one has seen
fire before, hearing the word “fire” may bring that image to mind; if not, the sound conveys
nothing. This observation dismantles the notion that words can generate meaning independently.
For Augustine, the relation between a word and its referent is always secondary to the knowledge
that precedes it. Outward signs rely entirely on prior recognition, which means they cannot
“teach” anything new.
The dialogue then moves from linguistic analysis to introspective reflection. Augustine
insists that when we understand something, we do not consult the person speaking to us but the
“Truth that presides within the mind itself, (though perhaps words prompt us to consult Him)”
(164). This moment marks a shift from theory to experience. The act of understanding becomes
something one observes happening internally, where words can serve as triggers for this process,
but they cannot cause it. Augustine compares this to the way light allows vision: external light
strikes the eyes, but sight itself is an inward act (165). Similarly, comprehension occurs when the
mind turns toward its own source of illumination. He uses this to set up his question, “What then
can be said to show that we learn something by words aside from the mere sound that strikes the
ears?” (165).
Augustine identifies the origin of this illumination as divine. “He who is consulted (…)
does teach: Christ—that is, the unchangeable power and everlasting wisdom of God” (164–165).
Having shown that no external teacher can impart knowledge, he resolves the question by
grounding true understanding in the divine presence within the soul. Words may awaken faith or
inspire inquiry, but faith itself only prepares the way for knowledge. Augustine presents this by
quoting the Prophet, “unless you believe, you shall not understand” (164). The argument thus
follows: the senses receive sound, the mind recognizes meaning, and the “spirit” perceives truth.
Through this progression, Augustine achieves his aim of redefining learning as an act of
illumination rather than instruction.
Augustine’s reasoning remains consistent with his theological premise, and his examples
of pointing, hearing, and remembering clearly demonstrate how signs operate without
transferring knowledge. The dialogue’s structure reinforces this, as Adeodatus’s understanding
emerges through reasoning rather than reception. By the end, Augustine shows that words merely
remind and not teach, since understanding depends on the mind’s prior illumination. That words
merely signify, that belief differs from knowledge, and that true learning arises from within,
altogether culminate in his central claim that understanding is not taught through speech but
awakened by the inner Truth within the individual (through divine illumination). However,
Augustine does not explain how this initial knowledge arises or why one might see the “light of
Truth” more clearly than another. Yet within the limits of his framework, the dialogue
convincingly shows that the source of understanding lies within, not in the sounds of language.
