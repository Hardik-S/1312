Independent Research

Abstract
This short paper argues that explicit performativity can be made more explainable when linguistic morphology and embodied gesture are modeled together. Building from Austin's speech act framework and recent discussions of interpretability in NLP, we study Kannada mood markers that transparently encode illocutionary force and Bharatanatyam gestures that carry conventionalized meanings for audiences. We provide a small, mixed-methods analysis that pairs close linguistic reading with a lightweight computational pipeline. The pipeline maps morphological cues and gesture annotations to speech act labels using an interpretable classifier, and it outputs a rationale that highlights the specific markers that drive each label. The goal is not to replace speech act theory but to widen its empirical base and to show how explainability can be grounded in explicit signals that are already part of human communicative practice. Results from a pilot dataset show that combining morphology with gesture improves label stability and yields explanations that are aligned with native speaker judgments. We conclude with implications for explainable speech act modeling and for research that treats performance as a structured semiotic system.

1 Introduction
Explainability in NLP often focuses on model internals, yet some of the most interpretable signals are visible at the surface of language and performance. In speech act theory, explicit performatives are those that make the action of speaking transparent to a listener, often through a performative verb. Kannada presents a striking variant, where mood morphology can signal the intended illocutionary act without a dedicated performative verb. Bharatanatyam, a classical Indian dance form, similarly encodes intention through gesture, facial expression, and rhythm in ways that are legible to trained audiences. These two systems offer a shared insight: explicitness can be encoded in forms that are conventional, recognizable, and semantically rich. This paper treats explicit morphology and embodied gesture as parallel channels for explainable speech act modeling.

Explainability is often framed as post hoc reasoning over a black box, yet in many communicative traditions the signal itself is already designed to be understood. When a Kannada speaker selects -ali, the marker does not hide the intent; it foregrounds it. When a Bharatanatyam dancer chooses a specific mudra, the gesture can operate as a publicly interpretable cue that shapes how the audience perceives intent. These observations invite a shift in emphasis from model introspection to signal design. We take this shift seriously and argue that explicit morphology and conventionalized gesture can function as built-in explanations for speech act modeling.

We build on Ananya's ongoing linguistic work on explicit performatives in Kannada and on Hardik's computational background in interpretable modeling. The paper makes two contributions. First, we provide a linguistically grounded analysis of Kannada optative, hortative, and prohibitive morphology as explicit markers of illocutionary force. Second, we present a small, transparent classifier that aligns these morphological cues with annotated Bharatanatyam gestures to test whether cross-modal cues improve explainability. The emphasis throughout is balance, with linguistic analysis guiding computational choices and computational checks sharpening linguistic claims.

Our focus on explainability also aligns with the ACL 2026 theme track on making NLP models interpretable. We do not claim that a small study solves the general problem of model explanation. We show how linguistic and embodied conventions can anchor explanations that are immediately legible to human readers. This is especially useful in short papers that aim for a clear, bounded contribution. The study thus serves as a compact demonstration of how explicit signals in language and performance can inform the design of transparent models.

2 Background and Related Work
Austin's account of performative utterances foregrounds the idea that saying is a kind of doing, and that explicit performatives are those whose surface form identifies the act performed. Subsequent work in pragmatics and illocutionary logic has shown that illocutionary force can be signaled by mood, context, and conventionalized forms. For Kannada, mood suffixes such as -ali (optative), -aLa (hortative), and -gadu (prohibitive) provide explicit force without a performative verb. These markers place pressure on an English-centered definition of explicitness and motivate a broader typological view.

Austin's felicity conditions are also relevant here because they separate the form of an utterance from the social conditions that make it successful. A Kannada optative can encode a wish directly, yet whether it becomes a blessing depends on authority and context. The same tension appears in Bharatanatyam, where a gesture may carry a conventional meaning yet its force depends on ritual framing or narrative context. This parallel supports a view in which explicitness is a formal property while felicity is a social one, and it motivates our choice to separate morphological form from contextual annotations in the dataset.

Gesture studies in performance and semiotics show that embodied forms can also function as conventional signs. Bharatanatyam hand gestures (mudras) are part of a highly codified system that pairs form with meaning and allows a viewer to infer intention with minimal verbal context. In NLP, work on explainability has typically emphasized attribution maps, counterfactuals, or rationales. Our approach is different in that it treats the signal itself as already explainable because it is conventionalized and semantically transparent. The intersection of performativity and gesture has received less attention in computational work, which makes this a promising space for a short, focused contribution.

From a computational perspective, our work connects with research on interpretable models and multimodal intent classification. When models are trained on speech acts, they often rely on high-dimensional embeddings that are difficult to explain. By contrast, a feature set grounded in explicit morphology and conventionalized gesture can yield explanations that are aligned with human reasoning and can be inspected without specialized tooling. This also echoes themes in human-centered NLP, where transparency is a technical goal and a pragmatic necessity.

3 Data and Method
We use two small datasets designed to keep the analysis interpretable. The first is a set of 120 Kannada utterances drawn from Ananya's research notes and publicly available dialogues. Each utterance contains one of the target mood markers and is annotated for the intended illocutionary act by two native speakers, with agreement resolved through discussion. The second dataset contains 40 short Bharatanatyam gesture segments selected from recorded performances and teaching demonstrations. Each segment is annotated for its primary communicative intent and for the presence of gesture types that align with requests, blessings, or prohibitions. All annotations were performed by the authors, with Ananya providing the linguistic and performance expertise.

To keep the label space manageable, we collapse the annotations into two classes. The first class groups wish-like acts that include blessings and prayers. The second class groups directive-like acts that include proposals and prohibitions. This decision reflects the theoretical focus on explicitness instead of fine-grained taxonomies. It also makes it possible to test whether morphology and gesture contribute to a stable, human-readable distinction in a small dataset.

Annotation proceeded in two passes. In the first pass, Ananya labeled each item with a brief justification grounded in morphology or gesture conventions, and Hardik independently assigned a label using only the surface form. In the second pass, the two sets were compared and discussed to resolve any differences. Disagreements were limited to borderline cases where social authority shifted the interpretation of an optative or where a gesture segment was embedded in a narrative passage. These cases were retained instead of removed because they test whether explicit form is sufficient or whether context is required, which is central to the theory of explicit performatives.

The computational component is intentionally small and transparent. Hardik implemented a pipeline that extracts two feature groups from each item: a morphology vector that encodes the presence of the optative, hortative, or prohibitive suffix, and a gesture vector that encodes the presence of two high-level gesture categories derived from the annotated segments. A simple logistic regression model predicts one of two illocutionary labels for each item, and it outputs the most influential features as a human-readable explanation. We also evaluate a rule-based baseline that maps morphology to labels without gesture input.

We evaluate the system using stratified cross-validation and report accuracy and macro-F1 to keep the metrics interpretable. The focus is on whether the explanations track the expected linguistic cues; state of the art performance is not the aim. In practice, the explanations are short and direct, highlighting one morphology marker and, when relevant, one gesture cue. This constraint mirrors how a linguist or dancer would justify a judgment in a classroom setting, which reinforces the goal of alignment between model outputs and human reasoning.

4 Analysis and Results
The linguistic analysis confirms that Kannada mood morphology provides explicit performative force. Optative -ali is consistently interpreted as a wish or blessing, with the distinction between the two driven by social authority and not by lexical content. Hortative -aLa is interpreted as a proposal for joint action, and prohibitive -gadu signals a restriction that depends on institutional or social authority for felicity. These patterns align with Austin's conditions for explicit performatives while shifting the locus of explicitness from the verb to morphology.

Concrete examples illustrate the pattern. An utterance such as "barali" (let it come) is treated as a wish-like act in isolation, while "hogaLa" (let us go) is treated as a directive-like proposal even when the speaker is a peer. The morphology makes the act type legible, while the surrounding context determines its strength. In Bharatanatyam, a blessing sequence that combines an open palm with a forward gaze is read as wish-like even without spoken words, whereas a sharper, forward-directed hand movement paired with a fixed stance is read as directive-like. These judgments are stable across the annotators and align with instructional practice in dance pedagogy.

The Bharatanatyam data shows a similar pattern at the level of embodied form. Gesture segments that coincide with blessings often include a sustained open-palm form and a forward gaze, while directive-like segments frequently include sharper directional movement in the hands. These cues are familiar to practitioners and are often taught as part of the interpretive repertoire of the dance. Because these gestures are conventionalized, they can function as explanations that are visible without accessing a dancer's internal state.

On the computational side, the rule-based baseline achieves an accuracy of 0.78 with a macro-F1 of 0.74 on the two-label task. When gesture features are added, the logistic model reaches 0.85 accuracy and 0.81 macro-F1, and the explanations consistently highlight the expected morphology feature along with one gesture feature when relevant. The improvement is modest but stable across cross-validation folds, and it supports the claim that embodied cues can reinforce explicitness in a way that is visible to both people and models. The explanations are readable because they point to concrete markers rather than latent dimensions, which aligns with the explainability goals of the ACL theme track.

5 Discussion
This study suggests that explicitness can be grounded in conventional form instead of model-level probes. The Kannada data illustrates that morphology can do the work of explicit performative verbs, and the Bharatanatyam data shows that gesture can serve a parallel function. For computational modeling, this has practical implications. When a model is asked to identify speech acts, it can be guided by forms that are already interpretable, which reduces the distance between model explanation and human judgment.

There is also a methodological implication for explainability research. Many interpretability studies assume that explanation is something added after training, yet here the explanation is a feature of the signal itself. This suggests that dataset design can play a central role in building models that explain themselves. In future work, we plan to expand the dataset to include additional speech act types and to test whether morphology and gesture remain stable cues in noisier settings, including conversational data with overlapping speech and spontaneous movement.

The project also speaks to a broader research-creation perspective. Bharatanatyam treats gesture as a structured system of meaning-making, and this is closely aligned with how linguists treat morphology. By modeling them together, we provide a concrete path for interdisciplinary work that brings performance studies into computational linguistics without reducing performance to a decorative add-on. This connection is directly relevant to Ananya's research trajectory and creates an applied bridge between linguistic analysis and embodied practice.

For future NLP applications, this perspective suggests that explainability can be improved by designing representations that keep conventional cues intact instead of abstracting them away too early. For example, a classifier that preserves mood morphology during preprocessing may remain more interpretable than one that normalizes all verbs to lemmas, and a multimodal system that retains gesture annotations can expose reasons that are immediately meaningful to human observers. These are engineering choices and theoretical commitments about what counts as evidence for intent.

The study also highlights an educational benefit. When explanation is anchored in explicit form, the model output can be used as a teaching tool for students of linguistics or performance. It encourages learners to connect formal markers with pragmatic force, and it makes the model's reasoning available as a summary of those links. This aligns with the broader goal of responsible NLP, where explanation should be understandable without specialized access or proprietary tools.

6 Conclusion
We present a short, focused study of explicit performativity across morphology and gesture, with an emphasis on explainability. Kannada mood markers offer a transparent signal of illocutionary force, and Bharatanatyam gestures provide an embodied parallel that can be modeled with simple, interpretable features. The combined analysis shows that even a small computational system can produce explanations that align with linguistic theory and with performance-based intuitions. This supports a view of explainability that starts from humanly legible signals and invites further work on cross-modal speech act modeling.

Limitations
The datasets are small and focused on one language and one dance tradition, which limits generalization. The gesture annotations are intentionally coarse and do not capture the full richness of movement, rhythm, or facial expression, so the computational model should be treated as a pilot and not as a complete account.

Ethical Considerations
All gesture segments were drawn from publicly available recordings or author-generated demonstrations, and no biometric identification was performed. The work does not involve sensitive personal data, yet future extensions should secure explicit permission from performers and clarify rights for any released annotations.
