Info for Paper to Submit to Conference (ACL / ARR)

Overview
- ACL uses ACL Rolling Review (ARR). You submit to ARR first (rolling review), then later commit the reviewed paper to a venue (ACL/NAACL/EMNLP/etc.) that accepts ARR reviews.
- Reviews are not open, but everything runs on OpenReview.

Critical policy changes
- All authors must register as reviewers; failure to complete review duties can make authors ineligible to submit in a future ARR cycle.
- After each submission deadline, all authors must complete the author registration form within 48 hours.
- Responsible checklist fields remain editable for 48 hours after the deadline.

Scope and topic selection
- ARR welcomes all CL/NLP topics. You must choose a topic area at submission to match AC/reviewers.
- Contribution types can be flagged (e.g., data resources, low-resource, interpretability, reproduction, surveys, etc.).

Paper types and length limits
- Long paper: up to 8 pages of main content.
- Short paper: up to 4 pages of main content.
- References are unlimited.
- Limitations section is required and must be placed after the conclusion and before references. It does not count toward the page limit.
- Optional Ethical Considerations section is recommended at the end of the paper.
- Missing the Limitations section or exceeding page limits leads to desk rejection.

Anonymity and submission rules (two-way anonymized review)
- No author names, affiliations, or self-identifying statements.
- Avoid self-references that reveal identity (use neutral citations).
- Supplementary materials and links must also be anonymized.
- Do not use file-hosting links that track downloads (Dropbox, etc.).

Preprint policy
- ARR allows preprints, but you must choose your preprint status during submission.
- If you choose a binding “non-preprint” option, you must not preprint until the review cycle ends; violation can cause desk rejection.
- Anonymous submission is incentivized by some venues for awards or borderline acceptances.

Authorship
- Include all and only people who made substantial contributions.
- No author changes after submission.
- Resubmissions require justification for any author changes (adds/removals).

Citation and comparison
- Cite all relevant refereed work.
- Cite the refereed version when a preprint has been superseded.
- Papers within 3 months of deadline are considered contemporaneous; deep comparison may be excused.

Multiple submission policy
- You cannot submit to ARR and any other venue (journal/conference) at the same time.
- You cannot submit to ARR while a commitment to a conference is active, and vice versa.
- Significant overlap with published or under-review work is not allowed.

Resubmission policy
- Resubmissions are allowed and must include a link to the prior submission.
- Provide a summary of changes plus a point-by-point response to prior reviews.
- Address all prior weaknesses; resubmitting unchanged work can be desk rejected.
- You may request new reviewers/AC with justification.

Withdrawal policy
- You can withdraw at any time.
- Withdrawal more than 48 hours after deadline may delay resubmission until the second subsequent ARR cycle.
- Once you have reviews, you cannot withdraw and resubmit as a new paper; use the resubmission process instead.

Ethics and Responsible NLP
- You must comply with the ACL Code of Ethics.
- Include a Limitations section; Ethical Considerations is recommended.
- Complete the Responsible NLP Checklist in the submission form.
- Incorrect or misleading checklist answers can cause desk rejection.

AI writing/coding assistance policy
- Generative AI tools do not qualify for authorship.
- Use must be disclosed in the Responsible NLP Checklist and Acknowledgements (except for basic proofreading tools).
- Authors remain responsible for correctness and must avoid plagiarism.

Reviewing obligations
- Submitting implies a reviewing obligation for all qualified authors.
- Reviewers must keep profiles up to date on OpenReview.
- Failure to review can lead to sanctions or future ineligibility.

Submission process and formatting
- Submit via OpenReview.
- Use the official ACL template; do not modify the style files.
- Follow ACL formatting rules (paper size, margins, font size).
- Submissions with formatting or anonymity violations are desk rejected.

Supplementary materials (optional)
- Appendices, software, and data are allowed but must be anonymized.
- Appendices go after references and should remain in double-column format.
- Software and data should be uploaded as separate .zip or .tgz archives.
- Reviewers are not required to consider appendices, so key content should stay in the main paper.

Desk rejection risks (common)
- Exceeding page limits or missing Limitations section.
- Any identity leakage (authors, affiliations, self-identifying citations).
- Dual submission or significant overlap with other publications.
- Incorrect or incomplete Responsible NLP Checklist.
- Formatting violations or modified template.

Checklist before submission
- Select the right topic area and contribution types.
- Confirm page limits (long: 8, short: 4) and include Limitations section.
- Ensure anonymity in paper and supplements; avoid tracked links.
- Confirm no dual submission or overlapping publication.
- Use ACL template and verify formatting.
- Prepare Responsible NLP Checklist and AI assistance disclosure.
- Ensure all authors will register and can fulfill reviewing duties.
